# 🍬 SweetShop TDD Project

Welcome to the **SweetShop** project—a modern, full-stack sweet shop management system built using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, FastAPI, and React (Vite). This repository demonstrates professional software engineering practices, robust authentication, and multilingual support for the Gujarat market.

---

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** All features are developed using the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle for reliability and maintainability.
- **Clean Architecture:** Separation of concerns across backend, frontend, and domain layers.
- **SOLID Principles:** Codebase designed for extensibility and maintainability.
- **Async FastAPI Backend:** High-performance, scalable API with JWT authentication and role-based access.
- **React + Vite Frontend:** Responsive, professional dashboard and forms with local asset management.
- **Gujarati Market Features:** Unicode support, authentic sweet names, and local reviews.
- **User Verification:** Only verified users can log in and access the dashboard.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** 100% passing backend tests (see backend/tests/README.md).

## 🤖 My AI Usage

### AI Tools Used
- **GitHub Copilot** (main)
- **ChatGPT** (for brainstorming and code review)

### How I Used AI
- I used **GitHub Copilot** to generate and refactor code for backend models, routers, and frontend React components, following SOLID and clean code principles.
- I asked **Copilot** to automate repetitive tasks, such as CRUD form generation, error handling, and session management logic.
- I used **ChatGPT** to brainstorm API endpoint structures, clarify TDD cycles, and review code for best practices.

### Reflection on AI Impact
- AI tools accelerated my workflow, especially for boilerplate code and refactoring to SOLID principles.
- Copilot helped maintain consistency and reduced manual errors in both backend and frontend code.
- ChatGPT provided valuable suggestions for API design and clean code structure.
- Using AI responsibly, I always reviewed and tested generated code to ensure quality and maintainability.
